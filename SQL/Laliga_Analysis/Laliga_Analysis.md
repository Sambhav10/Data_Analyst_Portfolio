                                      ***************Laliga Seasons Analysis *****************


**Business Task**
      
1. most wins for a team  across three season (2023/2022/2021)
2. Average possession  per season  
3. most shot vs most shot on target 
4. top 10 games with most attendance
5. best  / worse home  records     
6. best / worse away records
7. Most goal scored vs conceded across seasons
8.  Which  team is perfoming better overall ?    
-- We are gonna compare this with the following metrics   
	 -- goal scored  
        -- goal conceded  
	-- xg  -  means how many chances your team is getting to score a goal  
        -- xga - means how many chances your opponent is getting to score a goal against your team
    
    --   Idea  
     --  if avg of goal scored is greater than the average of xg( chance created ) and  
      -- if avg of goal conceded is less than average of xga(chanced conceded) then we know they are overperforming
